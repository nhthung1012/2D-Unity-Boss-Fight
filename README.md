# 2D Action Boss Fight Game (Unity)

A 2D action game prototype built with Unity, focusing on **boss combat design**, **phase-based AI**, and **reusable combat systems**.  
This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement gameplay systems suitable for an entry-level game developer role.
